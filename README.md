## About The Project

Dungeon Escape is a first-person puzzle game designed to be a peaceful and introspective experience. The player journeys through a series of serene chambers, manipulating objects and solving minimalist puzzles to find the path forward.

**This project was developed in two weeks as part of a larger 30-day focused C++ learning journey.** Its primary purpose is to serve as a professional portfolio piece, showcasing best practices in C++ development, scalable software architecture, and a disciplined source control workflow within Unreal Engine 5.

### Key Technical Features

* **Scalable Interaction System:** A functional, tag-based interaction system designed with a clear plan to be refactored into a C++ Interface pattern for maximum scalability and decoupling.
* **Dual Gameplay Mechanics:** Implements both a simple inventory-based system (for keys and locks) and a physics-based grabbing mechanic (`UPhysicsHandleComponent`), driven by a multi-state setup in the Enhanced Input System.
* **Functional UI/UX:** A complete in-game UI system featuring a pause menu and a persistent settings menu with fully functional graphics and audio controls.
* **Professional Git Workflow:** The project was managed with a clean, atomic commit history using Conventional Commits, and all large assets are correctly handled by Git LFS.

### Controls
* **WASD:** Move
* **Mouse:** Look
* **E / Left Mouse Button:** Interact / Grab
* **P:** Pause / Settings

### Built With
